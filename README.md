# AirBnB_clone

Project was done in teams of 2 people (team: Paschal Ugwu, Amarachi Nnanta)


## Project description

- This project is aimed at building a command-line interpreter for managing Airbnb objects. This initial step lays the foundation for the development of a full web application, encompassing HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API integration, and front-end development.
- It has a user-friendly interface used to interact with different functions and execute commands

## Description of the command interpreter

- A command interpreter, also known as a command-line interpreter (CLI) is a program that allows users to interact with a computer operating system or software application by entering text-based commands. 
- The command interpreter reads the entered commands, interprets them, and executes the corresponding operations.

## Getting started

Clone the repository to your machine make sure you have python installed (version 3.4 or higher) open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory

## How to use 

Once the command interpreter is active, you can interact with it using the following steps:

- 1) ENTER COMMANDS: Type commands after the prompt
- 2) EXECUTE COMMAND: Interpreter processes the command and perform the required action
- 3) VIEW RESULTS: Command output is displayed

## Examples:

The following are examples of commands in the command interpreter

1. `do_all`: Lists all instances of a given class or all classes if no class is specified. It provides a comprehensive overview of the objects stored in the data storage system.

2. `do_show`: Displays details of a specific instance based on the class name and instance ID provided as arguments. It is useful for retrieving specific information about an object.

3. `do_destroy`: Deletes a specific instance based on the class name and instance ID provided as arguments. This command allows for the removal of unwanted objects from the data storage system.

4. `do_count`: Counts and displays the number of instances of a specified class. It helps in understanding the quantity of objects belonging to a particular class.

5. `do_update`: Updates attributes of a specific instance based on the class name, instance ID, and key-value pairs provided as arguments. This command facilitates the modification of object attributes in the data storage system.
