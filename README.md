	PROJECT DESCRIPTION

	This project is aimed at building a command-line interpreter
	for managing Airbnb objects. This initial step lays the foundation for
	the development of a full web application, encompassing HTML/CSS templating,
	database storage, API integration, and front-end development.
	It has a user-friendly interface used to interact with different functions and
	execute commands

	COMMAND INTERPRETER DESCRIPTION

	A command interpreter, also known as a command-line interpreter (CLI)
	is a program that allows users to interact with a computer operating system or
	software application by entering text-based commands. The command interpreter
	reads the entered commands, interprets them, and executes the corresponding
	operations.

	GETTING STARTED

	clone the repository to your machine
    make sure you have python installed (version 3.4 or higher)
	open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory

	HOW TO USE 
	Once the command interpreter is active, you can interact with it using the following steps:

	1) ENTER COMMANDS: Type commands after the prompt
	2) EXECUTE COMMAND: Interpreter processes the command and perform the required action
	3) VIEW RESULTS: Command output is displayed

	EXAMPLES:
	The following are examples of commands in the command interpreter

	1) List: displays a list of available commands
	2) Adds: adds a new command with specified details
	3) Make: Makes a reservation
	4) Exit: Exits or terminates the command interpreter
