	PROJECT DESCRIPTION

	This project is aimed at building a command-line interpreter
	for managing Airbnb objects. This initial step lays the foundation for
	the development of a full web application, encompassing HTML/CSS templating,
	database storage, API integration, and front-end development.
	It has a user-friendly interface used to interact with different functions and
	execute commands

	COMMAND INTERPRETER DESCRIPTION

	A command interpreter, also known as a command-line interpreter (CLI)
	is a program that allows users to interact with a computer operating system or
	software application by entering text-based commands. The command interpreter
	reads the entered commands, interprets them, and executes the corresponding
	operations.
